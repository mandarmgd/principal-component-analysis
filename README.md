# principal-component-analysis

Implementation of principal component analyis from scratch (without using scikit-learn). I've used pandas and numpy along with some data visualization using seaborn. The only usage of scikit-learn is in the standardization of the data set's values which is crucial for this project. 

Data set used - iris
